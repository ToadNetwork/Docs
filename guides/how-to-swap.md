## Step 3: Select Tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
Performing a swap between two tokens requires an existing liquidity pool for this token pair on PADSwap and enough funds in the pool to perform your swap. If there is no or not enough liquidity, the UI will tell you and a swap it not possible. You can try to ask the community on [telegram](https://t.me/toadnetwork) to provide the liquidity for your desired token pair.
{% endhint %}

In order to swap any tokens, choose them from the drop down menu and enter the amount you want to swap.
