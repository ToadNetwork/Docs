# ðŸ—³ TOADao

## Governance

Besides the [team.md](team.md "mention"), the [community.md](community.md "mention") is increasingly involved in the development of the Toad.Network. Many decisions are already discussed, voted on, and decided by a group of active and dedicated community members via separate TG groups. Especially the steering of efforts, spending of proceeds and building of partnerships is increasingly done through these community members.

The TG groups are only a temporary solution towards a strong governance structure - a [#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao](toadao.md#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao "mention").

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

Governance via the TOADao will be coordinated using NFTs that grant voting powers. These are granted to community members who show commitment and dedication in helping the Toad.Network to advance. The mentioned community members already hold a Toad artwork custom made by the talented [PIRAMYD](https://piramyd.me). These artworks will later be linked to DAO NFTs and handed out to the individual community members via [toad-nft.md](../products/toad-nft.md "mention"). Proposals will be voted on through the blockchain.
