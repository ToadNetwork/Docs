## Contributions

We encourage contributions in terms of community engagement and marketing e.g. informing about the TOAD.Network on socials, sharing content, supporting other community members or by creating memes.

You can also help us improve our documentation to better explain the TOAD.Network ecosystem by suggesting improvements in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hTQ4z4Zn9p) group or even by directly contributing changes to the [docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs).

If you wish to help us promote TOAD, you can donate to the [multisig wallet](https://padswap.exchange/donate) managed by our marketing team.

While major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy, and overall development is ultimately decided on by the [Core Team](team.md).
