# Software Architecture

The Toad.Network contract and frontend code is completely hosted and actively maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/ToadNetwork). 

{% hint style="info" %}
Be aware, that many of the repositories you currently see public on [GitHub](https://github.com/ToadNetwork) are old outdated states. The main work is done on private repositories. Only the [team.md](../project/team.md "mention") and some community members have access to these repositories. This is just a temporary measure to protect the project from copy cats. We are planning on making the code public at some point.
{% endhint %}

Smart contracts developed are currently tested on Moonriver prior to deployment on Moonbeam.
