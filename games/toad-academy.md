# ðŸ•¹ TOAD Academy

[Toad Academy](https://toad.academy) is a side project of TOAD Network, aimed at combining **education** and **fun**.

Our goal is to familiarize people with difficult crypto-related concepts in intuitive and interactive ways.

On the [Toad Academy](https://toad.academy) website, you'll see two categories - [Apps](https://toad.academy/toolbox/) and [Games](https://toad.academy/games/)

[Apps](https://toad.academy/toolbox/) are more technical, and will allow you to better understand things like **impermanent loss** on LP tokens or **compounding your stake** for better returns.

[Games](https://toad.academy/games/) are more lighthearted. Some of them have educational elements (our [brick breaker game](https://toadgames.github.io/BrickBreaker/) is a good example), and some are just a way to take a break and have some fun.

Like everything in the TOAD ecosystem, Toad Academy is evolving, with new content added regularly and existing content being updated.

Our end goal is to reach a point where anyone can understand the most difficult concepts effortlessly and in the most entertaining way.
