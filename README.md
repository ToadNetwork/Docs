# What is the TOAD.Network?

## Introduction

TOAD.Network is an ecosystem of utilities and a community-driven organization built to solve common problems of Decentralized Finance. These problems include the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way; and even the issues of removing liquidity provision from projects (Rug-Pulling). Some solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, but TOAD.Network's progress is intended to initiate a broader, more impactful range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, TOAD.Network intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.

Thus far, the core products; include a unique anti-rug LP incentivization protocol ([**DPLP**](fundamentals/dplp.md)), multi-chain decentralized exchange/ AMM ([**PADSwap.Exchange**](products/padswap/)) running on BSC, Moonriver and Moonbeam, a forever rising price floor pegged index backing system ([**The Vault**](fundamentals/the-vault.md)), unique drip yield farms ([**Farms**](products/farms/)), and a new token Launchpad ([**LaunchPAD**](products/launchpad/)), and a GameFi Tool learning center ([**TOAD Academy**](games/toad-academy.md)). TOAD.Network's products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance by TOAD token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations.
