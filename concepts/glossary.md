## Annual Percentage Yield (APY)

The rate of return earned on an investment, taking into account the effect of compounding interest. Compounding with respect to [farms](../products/farms/ "mention") means, that your rewards will increase when you reinvest your received rewards.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You will only receive the shown APY if you always reinvest. The APY does not take transaction fees into account. You need to decide when to reinvest.

## Backing

Guarantee, that an asset can be exchanged with a fixed amount of another asset(s).

{% hint style="info" %}
See also [#pegging](glossary.md#pegging "mention"), which is a similar concept.
{% endhint %}

## Burn

Existing tokens which no one has any access to (and never will) are considered to be burned. Burning tokens is often done by sending tokens to an address which can not be accessed. For example, on BSC [0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD](https://bscscan.com/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) is such an address.

There are several reasons to burn tokens:

1. Demand and supply define a tokens price. Burning tokens reduces the supply and given existing demand will increase the price.
2. Liquidity providers get LP tokens as collateral for withdrawal of their share of the liquidity pool. Burning these LP tokens means that no one can withdraw the respective liquidity and therefore increases the security for users. See also [#rug-pulling](glossary.md#rug-pulling "mention").

## Farming

Please read the linked page to understand what farming is:

{% content-ref url="../products/farms/" %}
[farms](../products/farms/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Index

Measures the combined value of a basket of assets.

## Index Backing

Guarantee, that an asset can be exchanged with a fixed amount of other assets.

## Inflationary Token

Token with increasing circulating supply without max supply.

## Liquidity Pool

Please read the linked page to understand what a liquidity pool is:

{% content-ref url="../products/padswap/liquidity-pools.md" %}
[liquidity-pools.md](../products/padswap/liquidity-pools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Max Supply

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Minting

Increasing the total supply of a token by releasing new tokens. If a token has a max supply, then the number of tokens which can be minted is limited by the max supply. If there is no max supply, the token can be minted infinitely and is therefore considered to be an inflationary token.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Pegging

If the price of one asset is bound to the price of another asset(s).

Stable coins like BUSD are one example of pegging. Since BUSD is pegged by USD, you expect 1 BUSD will always have the same value as 1 USD.

{% hint style="info" %}
See also [#backing](glossary.md#backing "mention"), which is a similar concept.

## Rug Pulling

If someone takes away important support of a project, this is known as rug pulling. This can make a token worthless due to a severe price reduction or by removing the ability to sell.

There are many forms of rug pulling, e.g.:

1. Removing large portions of a liquidity pool, which removes the ability to sell.
2. Selling high percentages of the circulating token supply in a short period of time, which drastically reduces the token price.

## Staking

If you put your tokens into a pool (e.g. a farm) then you effectively own a share of that pool. In other words, you have a stake in the pool. The process of you suppling your tokens to the pool is therefore called staking.
