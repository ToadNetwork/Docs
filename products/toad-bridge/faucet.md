Faucet on PADSwap
{% endembed %}

When you get onto a new chain (e.g. via our [.](./ "mention")), you most likely do not have any chain native token (e.g. GLMR on Moonbeam). You need chain native tokens to pay transactions fees. So without it, you can not swap on [padswap](../padswap/ "mention") or stake on our [farms](../farms/ "mention").

The faucet is a way that others can provide you a small amount of chain tokens to pay your first transaction fees.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the chain tokens you get from the faucet to buy some more chain tokens so that you can also pay for future transaction fees.
{% endhint %}

Others can provide you with a code which you can enter to redeem the linked tokens.

{% hint style="success" %}
For now, this is a great service of PADSwap, gifting you chain tokens so that you can get started. You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hTQ4z4Zn9p) or [Telegram](https://t.me/toadnetwork) group and ask for a faucet code there.\
Later, everyone can create codes. When this is live and if you got help via our faucet, make sure to help other community members by also providing faucet codes.
