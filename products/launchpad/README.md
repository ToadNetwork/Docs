## What is the LaunchPAD?

The LaunchPAD is a service for projects to launch a token via a presale IDO. Users can participate in the presale to support the project.

The purpose of the LaunchPAD is to make token launches as safe as possible for users and as easy as possible for developers. Take care of your community and let TOAD handle the rest! LaunchPAD also offers a large variety of tools to boost projects' liquidity and utility. We believe developers should be able to focus entirely their products and the community as we know first hand how many obstacles there can be in this space to growth. We hope to set an industry standard where users feel safe that Developers will not be able to rug or act maliciously with LP. Obviously, this is not a magic solution- some projects that do not offer anything new are still going to only perform as well as the market allows. However, this is leaps above current protocols and eliminates rug pulling altogether.

The LaunchPAD provides a [token-factory.md](token-factory.md "mention") for a zero coding deployment of your token.

You can launch your token on PADSwap via a [token-presale.md](token-presale.md "mention"), where your community can invest in your project. We provide you the presale systems, a referral program to promote your presale and after your successful launch, we automatically set up [liquidity-pools.md](../padswap/liquidity-pools.md "mention") and your projects [dplp-farms.md](../farms/dplp-farms.md "mention").

## Future Development

{% hint style="info" %}
The docs show the current state of the launchpad. For example, but not limited to, the following features are planned in the future:

* Launch token without any coding experience based on modular building blocks
* Have all possible token contracts audited so that all launching tokens are audited from the get go.
* Have the presale contract audited
* Also release the token factory on BSC and Moonbeam
* AUDITED Farms (TOKEN-BNB|MOVR|GLMR, TOKEN-BUSD|USDC, TOKEN-PAD)
* Partner Farms available for whitelisted Projects
* Auction Contract
* Full set of free BOGtools, Chart, Limit Orders, Telegram Bot
* Discounted Moonlight Bubble Maps List
* Free Unifaucet List for reflections.
* [Token Sniffer](https://tokensniffer.com) Listing
* And more...
