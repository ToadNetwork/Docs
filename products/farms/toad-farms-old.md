# üê∏ TOAD Farms (old)

{% hint style="danger" %}
The TOAD farms are slowly phased out. Make sure to switch to our [dplp-farms.md](dplp-farms.md "mention"). There is no migration, you will have to unstake and restake.

The Original TOAD DPLP has 1% burned, the other 9% returning to the rewards pool.

The Original TOAD DPLP liquidity is hosted on **PancakeSwap V1** liquidity contracts, while PAD‚Äôs has its own personalized and audited contract specifically setup to correct PancakeSwap V1 liquidity limits and is fully managed by the PADSwap ecosystem.

TOAD developers donated their initially reserved LP tokens to the TOAD pool. There is no way these tokens can be removed except by farming it when providing liquidity and joining to the LP Farm.
