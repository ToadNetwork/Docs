## Rewards and Distribution

In Partner farms you can earn tokens of partner projects. This section describes, where these partner tokens come from and how they are distributed.

### Where do rewards come from?

Why should I care, you may ask. High APY is better, right? Not necessarily! See our notes on [#high-vs.-stable-apy](./#high-vs.-stable-apy "mention").&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewards are not actively distributed and instead stay in the pool until they are claimed. The UI just calculates and shows your claimable rewards.
