Use our fiat on-ramp
{% endembed %}

PADSwap provides fiat on-ramping via [Onramper](https://onramper.com). You can buy crypto with fiat directly via PADSwap. No need to use a CEX for that.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Onramper takes a 1% fee. To keep the fees acceptable for our users PADSwap does not take any additional fees. The 1% are still much lower than e.g. the 1.8% taken by Binance.
