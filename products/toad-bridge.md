PADSwap operates on multiple chains like BSC, Moonriver and Moonbeam. The bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of tokens from one chain to another. Both chains can have different protocols, rules and governance models, but the bridge provides a compatible way to interoperate securely on both sides.

## Instructions for bridging tokens

The following guide walks you through the process of bridging a token from one chain to another:

## Bridged Tokens

Currently anyone can bridge our whitelisted tokens from Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to and from Moonriver (MOVR) as well as to and from Moonbeam (GLMR).

Tokens currently whitelisted:

* TOAD
* BNB
* BUSD

Catoshi "[The Crossing](https://the-crossing.io)" Whitelisted Tokens are also in line to be added. This will allow direct access of the utility, farming that PADSwap offers to Ethereum, Fantom and Poly Network.
