Link to the TOAD Bridge on PADSwap
{% endembed %}

PADSwap operates on multiple chains like BSC, Moonriver and Moonbeam. The bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of tokens from one chain to another. Both chains can have different protocols, rules and governance models, but the bridge provides a compatible way to interoperate securely on both sides.

Currently anyone can bridge TOAD from Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to and from Moonriver (MOVR). Soon we also have a bridge for Moonbeam (GLMR).

Tokens currently whitelisted:

* TOAD
* BNB
* BUSD
* Catoshi "The Crossing" Whitelisted Tokens are also in line to be added. This will allow direct access of the utility, farming that PADSwap offers to Ethereum, Fantom and Poly Network.
