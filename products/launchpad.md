# 🚀 LaunchPAD

LaunchPAD beta will allow anyone to launch their own project without any coding experience. Any project created on LaunchPAD beta will start with:

AUDITED Presale Contract

AUDITED BEP20 | MOVR Token | GLMR Token

AUDITED Farms (TOKEN-BNB|MOVR|GLMR, TOKEN-BUSD|USDC, TOKEN-PAD)

AUDITED DPLP FARMS (DECENTRALIZED PERPETUAL LIQUIDITY PROTOCOL)

Partner Farms available for whitelisted Projects

RUG-PROOF Project Batch\
\
Auction Contract\
\
Full set of free BOGtools, Chart, Limit Orders, Telegram Bot

Discounted Moonlight Bubble Maps List

Free Unifaucet List for reflections.

LaunchPAD beta will receive a percentage of every presale and a small fee for creating the project, those fees are going to be converted to TOAD/BNB | TOAD/MOVR | TOAD/GLMR and donated to DPLP.

The purpose of the LaunchPAD is to make token launches as safe as possible for users and as easy as possible for developers. It will also offer a large variety of tools to boost projects' liquidity and utility. Developers should be able to focus on their products and the community. This will set a industry standard where they feel safe Developers will not be able to rug or act maliciously with LP. Obviously, this is not a magic solution- some projects that do not offer anything new are still going to only perform as well as the market allows. However, this is leaps above current protocols and eliminates rug pulling altogether.
